NOTES:

Potential activities:
- Using learner corpora to observe different options for a translator and reflect on mistakes or inadequate solutions.
- Translation of short passages yielded by a concordancer.
  - Here we go from the paradigmatic (possible values of a given item as they would be found in a corpus-based dictionary) to the syntagmatic (how the item in question is embedded in a given text).
  - Bridges the gap between cross-linguistic contrast and meaning or function in context.

BROWN Corpus
- 1 million words
- Samples of equal length
- Very few whole texts, which means that organisational features may not be adquately represented.

Evaluating Corpora - Criteria?
  - Type of Corpus
    - Monolingual vs Bilingual/Multilingual
    - Static vs Dynamic
    - Parallel vs comparable
    - Ad hoc vs permanent?
  - Size
  - Full texts or samples?
  - Balanced or unbalanced?
  - Homogeneous (created for a specific purpose) or heterogeneous (created for reference/non-specific purposes)
