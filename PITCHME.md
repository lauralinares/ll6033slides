### What is a corpus?

In corpus linguistics (and TS):

> [A] collection of texts in electronic format which are processed and analyzed using software specifically created for linguistic research (Zanettin 2012)

<!--- It is important to stress that a corpus is not simply a collection of electronic texts. In order to have a corpus we need a purpose for collecting and analyzing them, and a set of criteria for selecting and describing them (Zanetting 2012)

"The notion of what may constitute a corpus seems to defy simple definitions based on the corpus-as-object alone and is best approached in a wider perspective including considerations on both form and purpose"-->

---
### What is a corpus?

> (...) each new study in corpus linguistics assumes -implicitly or explicitly- a definition of corpus which entails fundamental criteria and standards. (Gatto 2014)

### Key elements of corpora

Authenticity
<!--- Corpus linguistics is by definition an empirical approach to the study of language based on the observation of authentic data. REAL EXAMPLES OF LANGUAGE USE (rather than introspection).
Chomsky - Only interested in the abstract, universal competence, and not the contingent expressions of that performance. HALLIDAY - Metaphor of the weather: Relationship between authentic real-life instances of language use and the invisible abstract system can be compared to the relationship between the weather, relating to the next few hours or days, and the climate, as the summation of each day’s weather (Halliday 1991: 45)
For corpus linguists, the abstract and the real exist in a continuum. So we can access the abstract through examples of the real. --->

### Key elements of corpora

Representativeness

> A corpus is not simplpy a collection of texts. Rather, a corpus seeks to represent a language or some part of a language. The appropriate design for a corpus therefore depends upon what it is meant to represent. (Biber et al. 1998: 246)

---
### Key elements of Corpora

Representativeness

* Type of texts
* Number of texts
* Selection of particular texts
* Selection of text samples
* Length of text samples
---
### Key elements of Corpora

Representativeness

* Is representativeness possible?
* Why is it such a key issue?

---
### Key issues in corpora

Balance and sampling

<!--- A balanced corpus is supposed to cover a wide range of text categories considered to be representative of language or variety under scrutiny. Such categories are sampled proportionally so as to offer a 'manageably small scale model of the linguistic material which the corpus buidlers wish to study' (Atkins et al.) -->

  - Balance of texts
  - Balance of sample sizes

<!--- How might this affect the way you create a corpus for translation? Or you evaluate a readily available corpus? -->

---
<!--- Composition of the BNC image --->

---
### Key issues in Corpora

Size

<!--- Growing in size all the time: corpora used for building dictionaries today, eg. Collins Cobuild Bank of English amount to 650 million words. -->

---

### Types of corpora

Reference vs. specialised

<!--- Reference: texts from a variety of domains, genres and register, as large a representation as possible. Uses: producing reference materials such as grammar books or dictionaries.
Specialised - Only one variety, eg. medical discourse. -->

---

### Types of corpora

Synchronic vs. diachronic
---
### Types of Corpora

Dynamic vs. static
---
### Types of Corpora

Monolingual vs. Multilingual
---
### Types of Corpora

Parallel vs. comparable

<!--- Parallel: Original texts and their translations / Comparable: Two or more collections of texts similar in genre, topic, time span, and communicative fucntion.-->
<!--- What can parallel corpora be useful for in translation? And comparable ones? --->

### The Web as Corpus

- Web as an 'exhaustive' rather than 'representative' corpus of the language used in electronic written communication.
- Huge Size
- Uneven quality of the texts it contains
- Issues of authenticity (authoritativeness)
---
> Everyday experience suggests that 'authentic' in the web often means inaccurate (misspelt words, grammar mistakes, improper usage by non-native speakers), i.e. texts that are almost certainly authentic in terms of their communicative intent but may be unreliable and lacking authority at the level of code. (Gatto 2014)


---

### The web as/for Corpus
- Two options:
  - Web as a macro-corpus: Application of parameters to restrict the results of searches (Bergh 2005)
  - Web as a source of texts:
    - For large reference corpora (eg. COCA)
    - For DIY disposable corpora
---

### Key issues of the Web as corpus

* Authenticity <!---- Biggest asset! BUT unsupervised: authenticity might mean misspellings, grammar mistakes, improper usage, usage by non-native speakers, etc. --->
* Representativeness <!--- Certain areas under-represented and others under-represented. Lew notes that an inordinately high proportion of web-based texts are about the web itself or about high-technology
Also: the web as a marketing tool! Repetition of keywords: Is that representative of natural language? Can we even talk about authentic language?
Finally, it also depends on the language -->
* Size <!--- Overwhelming? --->
* Dynamism
* Relevance and reliability
* Access
---
<!--- First, not all documents contain text, and many of those that do are not
only text. Second, it changes all the time. Third, like Borges’s Library of
Babel, it contains duplicates, near duplicates, documents pointing to duplicates that may not be there, and documents that claim to be duplicates
but are not. Next, the language has to be identifed (and documents may
contain mixes of language). Then comes the question of text type: to gain
any perspective on the language we have at our disposal in the web, we
must classify some of the millions of web pages, and we shall never do
so manually, so corpus linguists, and also web search engines, need ways
of telling what sort of text a document contains: chat or hate-mail; learned
article or bus timetable. (Kilgarriff 2001) --->

- Internet searches: Google
- Search operators

### Web as macro-Corpus
"exact match search"

### Web as macro-Corpus
Boolean Operators: OR, AND, NOT
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
-term <!--- Exclude a term or phrase. Eg. jobs -apple will return things realted to jobs but not to apple-->
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
Wildcards (\*)
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
() <!--- Group multiple terms or search operators to control how the search is executed eg. (ipad OR iphone) apple --->
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
AROUND(X) <!--- Proximity search. Find pages containing two words or phrases within X words of each other. eg. apple AROUND (4) iphone means that the words apple and iphone must be present in the content and no further than four words apart.-->
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
map:
  - _ <!--- Acts as a wildcard for Google Autocomplete-->
  - .. <!--- Search for a range of numbers. Eg. jobs 2010..2014-->
---
### Web as macro-Corpus
loc:placename <!--- Results from a given area-->
  - @ <!--- Social media eg. phone recall @twitter--->

---
A Google a Day!

---
### Uses of parameters

**Phrase search and collocation** <!--- Particularly interesting when you are translating into your second language! --->

Heavy rain vs. thick rain (Gatto 2014) <!--- Even allowing for a number of these results to be irrelevant, the number of hits retrieved is huge) BUT always be aware of noise!! -->

---

### Uses of parameters

**Phraseology and patterns**

"To * a better future"

Gluten sensitive enteropathy (Gatto 2014)
    * gluten * enteropathie:
          * Entéropathie au gluten
          * Entéropathie d'intolerance au gluten
          * Entéropathie induite par le gluten.
---

### Uses of parameters

Disambiguation

Surgical removal or decompression of cysts

(Maniez 2007) <!--- Does surgical refer to both removal and decompression or only to removal? Web counts returned for the search surgical decompression (200,000) indicate the former is probably the case)-->
